# Loewner-John-Quotients-of-projected-random-0-1-Polytopes

This program was developed as part of my bachelor thesis on the Löwner-John-Quotients of projections of random 0/1-Polytopes.
That was done in order to investigate via experiments how "spherical" random 0/1-Polytopes of higher dimensions can be.
The program consists of 4 files, with main.py containing the method to compute said Löwner-John-Quotients depending on given parameters.
lownerjohn_ellipsoid.py was not written by myself. It is instead a case study in the MOSEK Fusion API for Python, available under https://docs.mosek.com/9.0/pythonfusion/case-studies-ellipsoids.html.
